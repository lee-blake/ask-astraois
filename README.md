# Warnings
As part of this project, some warnings have been suppressed globally:
- "unused": This inspection has been suppressed whenever there is one of the following annotations, as PicoCLI is responsible for injecting them at runtime:
    - `@picocli.CommandLine.Parameters`
    - `@picocli.CommandLine.Option`
